# **Brainfuck**
##### STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ([Roadmap](https://github.com/DrParanoya/Brainfuck/blob/main/ROADMAP.md))
### Brainfuck processor written in C++. Features support for randomness, JIT compilation and AOT compilation.
### This implementation has 65 536 memory cells (uint16_t limit).
##
When running this, a terminal will open.  
Enter the filepath to your brainfuck file (file extension doesn't matter).  
###### A regex search will be performed to read the flags, anything behind the flags will be appended to the file path!
The following flags are allowed:  

`-i` will just interpret the code (default, will be used if no mode is specified).  
`-e` will compile the code first and then run the generated bytecode.  
`-c` will compile the code into a `.bfbc` (stands for [*BrainFuckByteCode*](https://github.com/DrParanoya/Brainfuck/blob/main/BFBC.md)) file.  
`-r` will try to run a `.bfbc` from the filepath you entered.  
`-a` will turn your brainfuck code into C++ code and store it in a `.cpp` file.  
`-l` will perform a check if all brainfuck loops open and close correctly. Runs automatically with `-e`, `-c` and `-a` to prevent errors.  
  
`-?` will enable randomnes (every `?` inside your brainfuck code will randomize the value of the current cell).  
`-!` will ignore incorrect loops (turn this on if you want to try out what non-text files do)  

Important: `-!` and `-?`  should only be placed after the mode flag!

### Examples:  
> ##
> `C:\Users\User\Desktop\Brainfile.txt -e -?`  
> This will compile `Brainfile.txt` into `Brainfile.txt.bfbc` with support for randomnes and run it.
> ##
> `C:\Users\User\Desktop\HelloBf.bfbc -r`  
> This will execute the BrainFuckByteCode inside the `HelloBf.bfbc` file without support for randomnes.
> ##
> `C:\brainfuck_code.txt`  
> This will interpret the file `brainfuck_code.txt` without support for randomnes.
> ##
> `C:\Users\User\Images\Screenshot22.png -?`
> This will interpret the file `Screenshot22.png` with support for randomnes.
