# **Brainfuck**  
### Brainfuck processor written in C++. Features support for randomness and JIT compilation  

When running this software, a terminal will open. Enter the filepath to your Brainfuck file as well as the mode it should execute in after ` -`.  
  
`-c` will compile the file at your filepath into a `.bfbc` (stands for *BrainFuckByteCode*) file.  
`-r` will try to run a `.bfbc` from the filepath you entered.  
`-i` will just interpret it.  
`-e` will compile it first and then run the generated bytecode.  

To use randomness, place the `?` character into your code. It will set te current cell to a random vaule.  
You also need to put ` -r` behind the mode.  
### Example:  
> `C:\Users\User\Desktop\Brainfile.txt -e -r`  
> This will compile `Brainfile.txt` into `Brainfile.bfbc` with support for randomness and run it.
